<strong>CarpetCreate</strong> is an extension for both [Carpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet) and [Create](https://github.com/Fabricators-of-Create/Create), integrating the two seamlessly into an all-around clockwork technical experience! Besides the ability to modify the behaviours of Create's components to better suit a building environment, <strong>CarpetCreate</strong> offers many bug fixes and enhancements to the existing features, making your playthrough as smooth as it can possibly be!

Once you have downloaded [Carpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet) and [Create](https://github.com/Fabricators-of-Create/Create), simply drag Carpet, Create (along with its own dependencies) and <strong>CarpetCreate</strong> into your Fabric mods folder. If you're playing on a multiplayer server, you'll need to have these mods installed on both the server and client sides.
